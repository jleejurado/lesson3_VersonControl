            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control, sometimes referred to as revision or source control, is an element of software configuration management that monitors the changes made to a computer’s documents, programs, websites, or other collections of data. The changes that are made to the data, called “revisions” are identified with a number or letter code in order to help the developer stay organized. Revisions are recorded with timestamps and can be deleted, restored, or manipulated to the developer’s needs. While version control systems are independent applications, they are often embedded in other common applications such as Microsoft Office or collaborative online documents to guard against lost data and disorganization. Version control is very important in daily life and especially this class. Online collaboration is an essential part of coding with a team of developers, and VCS makes the process marginally easier.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A local repository is a repository that resides on a local machine of an individual user. In order to generate a local repository, a user must create one from scratch or clone an existing remote repository. While remote repositories are more widely used, local repositories still have their benefits. One of these benefits is the easy and fast access, as all of the files exist on the device currently accessing it. However, local repositories can be large and take up more space than proves useful. For this reason, I feel that we should understand local repositories for this class, but may not use them as often as remote repositories.

                <span class="text-muted">Remote Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A remote repository, in contrast to a local repository, is a repository that resides on a remote server, making it easily shareable between multiple developers. Remote repositories are very important when working with code. Often times, developers work in teams on various projects. Sometimes two or more projects can be in development simultaneously. These teams cannot be in constant contact and conversation about every change made to a project. A remote repository allows teams of developers to work together distantly while keeping detailed track of each change made. Programming innovation would be several years behind modern day accomplishments without the use of remote repositories. They are very important to this class as well as any future career we students choose to pursue.

                <span class="text-muted">Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a version control system designed to handle both large and small projects with ease and speed. Git is free and open source, making it a very useful tool for a developer when working on a project of any kind. Using git allows developers to house a copy of the repository on a local computer while also preventing mistakes when overwriting any part of the code within the remote repository. It is a very important VCS for our class to have an understanding of, for it streamlines a lot of the troublesome processes when dealing with various different projects.

                <span class="text-muted">Git Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git commands are specific commands made by the developer to the git version control system. Git can be confusing for first time users, myself included, so it is recommended to regularly visit a list of git commands to familiarize yourself with as many commands as possible. Some git commands are used explicitly with a local repository, and some commands only have purpose in a remote repository. It is important to know the type of repository that a developer is working with before implementing git commands. In this class, we will be working closely with git and git commands in both local and remote repositories.
