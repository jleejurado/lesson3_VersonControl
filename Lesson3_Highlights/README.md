## Project Description:
In Lesson 3, we were given the instructions to set up our GitHub account and link it to our Cloud9 account. After that was done, we were to sucessfully move the assignment from the local repository to the remote repository. Following this, we were to summarize 5 main concepts from the Lesson 3 reading assignments and upload the final project to GitHub.

## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. I learned the differences between a local and remote repository, as well as the pros and cons of each type of repository.
2. When first reading over the instructions for this assignment, I was confused about the process of moving my files from a local to a remote repository. After reading through the module and experiencing the process hands-on, I feel I understand it much better.
3. I feel that I have become much more familiar with Git commands, something that will probably be very useful in the upcoming lessons as well as a future career.
